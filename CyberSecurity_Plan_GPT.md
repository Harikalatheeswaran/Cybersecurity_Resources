# Cybersecurity Certification Roadmap (Personal Plan)

## 🔹 My Honest Recommendation for You

Since you want to become a full-fledged hacker + land a role fast in India:

### 1. Security+ – ✅ keep doing it
- Great foundation, good to mention in CV.  
- Builds your basics (threats, attacks, controls).  

### 2. CCNA – ❌ skip the cert, ✅ learn the knowledge
- No need to spend money/time on the exam.  
- Just self-study:
  - Subnetting  
  - Routing  
  - VLAN  
  - NAT  
  - Firewalls  
  - Packet flow  
- That’s enough for hacking.  

### 3. CEH – ✅ do it (resume booster in India)
- Even though it’s not hands-on, it will help you get shortlisted.  
- Pair it with eJPT and you’ll look both **HR-ready + technically strong**.  

### 4. eJPT – ✅ must do
- This is where your actual hacking begins.  
- Proves **hands-on skill in pentesting**.  

### 5. OSCP – ✅ ultimate goal
- The cert that proves you’re a penetration tester.  
- You’ll be **industry ready** after this.
